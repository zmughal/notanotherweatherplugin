Not Another Weather Wordpress Plugin
=======================

So you're creating this awesome minimalistic template, and you think to yourself...some
pretty awesome weather stats would surely come in handy here.

You look around for widgets that will provide you with the most minimalistic settings, 
just the stats would suffice...but nope, all the other widgets out there provide you
with these bulky weather elements that you'll just end up customizing in the end, and
to top it off it is based on a given zip code not the user's location.


Well, Not Another Weather Plugin, is a minimalistic approach at acquring weather
information based on your users ip address with no fluff. 

Just install the plugin, call the widget where needed, or even better use the functions
within the plugin and design your own widget.


Well What's The Catch?
====================================

It's in its early stages. You will need to acquire your own IP and Yahoo Weather APIs.

Stay tuned for updates.

Also, a duct tape approach at improving an existing plugin, Xerxes Weather plugin for
Wordpress, was initially taken, but scrapped. The widget was handy, but the entire
plugin just needed to be built from the ground up.
